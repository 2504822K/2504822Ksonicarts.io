# WEEK 4 
## GETTING STARTED WITH TRACK 1

Overall Aim: The aim main of this week is to download source files from NASA and to compose an Undercurrent for track 1. 

To start off, I know that NASA released a collection of their sounds from different missions on SoundCloud in 2014. These sounds are available under a creative commons license.

### To Do 
 A Todo list for tasks to breakdown my goals 

1. Download as many NASA Audio files as possible
2. Look out for quality and how they could fit together as you listen to them
3. Download into one folder
4. Learn how to make an Undercurrent 
5. Watch video by The Daydream Sound on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00Vz7ybWp_c&t=3s&ab_channel=TheDaydreamSound)
6. Select a number of NASA sounds which could make up the Undercurrent track

### Reflections

#### Begining of the week 

- So far, I have combed through as many NASA sounds as I can and downloaded any sounds which sound interesting and fit into the sound worlds I am envisioning. I saved these on a folder titled Space Sounds on my computer. Below is a picture of the spacesounds folder which I ended up using for the project.

### Middle of the Week 

I think I now have a sizeable amount of sound tracks to use, but I think I will go back to the folder and download more if required. Some sounds have inspired a direction I could take. 


## Composing Undercurrent track 
1. Start with a bass sound - maybe the second kepler sound (Kepler Big Boom)
2.  The undercurrent should last the duration of the entire track. 
3. The undercurrent should constantly shift but should be subtle and in the background
4. The undercurrent is great for moments of silence within a piece. It gives a piece of music an atmosphere, or ambience and gives it life.
5. You could start it off with the 590329main_ringtone sound and then build to the DelatIVaudio, let the sound wall build up and then abruptly shift it to a pure clean sine tone. The visuals could go from black static to a clear white tone.

### Reflections 

#### End of the week 

I am really stuggling creating the undercurrent. I have so many ideas and I am unsure which ones are better. I dont know what I am composing towards anymore. All I know is I have made 3 different undercurrents and none of them inspire me. I feel a bit dejected and worried about the deadline.
