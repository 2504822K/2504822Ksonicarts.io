# WEEK 4 
## GETTING STARTED WITH TRACK 1

Overall Aim: The aim main of this week was to download source files from NASA and to compose an Undercurrent for track 1. 

To start off, I knew that NASA had released a collection of their sounds from different missions on SoundCloud in 2014. I knew that these sounds were available under a creative commons license. So I combed through as many as I could and downloaded any sounds which were interesting and fit into the sound worlds I was trying to build. I saved these on a folder titled Space Sounds on my computer. 

### To Do 
I made a Todo list for tasks to breakdown my goals 

1. Download as many NASA Audio files as possible
2. Look out for quality and how they could fit together as you listen to them
3. Download into one folder
4. Learn how to make an Undercurrent 
5. Watch video by The Daydream Sound on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00Vz7ybWp_c&t=3s&ab_channel=TheDaydreamSound)
6. Select a number of NASA sounds which could make up the Undercurrent track

## Composing Undercurrent track 
1. Start with a bass sound - maybe the second kepler sound (Kepler Big Boom)
2.  The undercurrent should last the duration of the entire track. 
3. The undercurrent should constantly shift but should be subtle and in the background
4. The undercurrent is great for moments of silence within a piece. It gives a piece of music an atmosphere, or ambience and gives it life.
5. You could start it off with the 590329main_ringtone sound and then build to the DelatIVaudio, let the sound wall build up and then abruptly shift it to a pure clean sine tone. The visuals could go from black static to a clear white tone.
