# WEEK 5

## TRACK 1 BREAKTHROUGH 

After struggling so much putting my ideas into action, I looked through my previous projects in Sonic Arts. I discovered that the project I enjoyed the most was last year's Sound for Narrative Film project. So I examined awhy I enjoyed this project more. I discovered that I liked it because I had a story to compose to. Having a story in mind made the ideas I was trying to achieve easier since I could then just figure out which compositional or methods tools would work best for those ideas. So I used this same logic for my composition. I came up with a general storyline which I could use to shape the emotional context, and arrangement of my piece. However, I decided that even though I had used this story as a guide, whoever listens to my music should make their own conclusions as to what the music is about (if anything), the story is not necessary for enjoying the final piece. If I was to publish the piece on streaming platforms, the story would not be included. This way the music is a standalone composition. 

## The story I came up with 

I imagined a first time astronaut in a spaceship afraid to leave the spaceship for the first time, he is stuck inside hearing the wind outside(this is the background sounds), he can also hear parts of spaceship machinery warring and engine running. Eventually, he masters the courage to head out, and at the threshold, he panics (this is the crescendo), and then eventually steps out, and is taken aback at the view he sees, this is when the melody which was incomplete and was heard at the beginning of the piece comes back and this time it is completed and the piece ends. The start of this melody can also be heard oscillating between two notes in the middle of the piece. I thought this could signify his reluctance. 

## Taking inspiration from Interstellar

Since I had already had a theme in mind (space), I looked up music composed with a similar theme.  In my research, I came across the music of Interstellar 

## Notes from How Hans Zimmer Creates the Sound of Space in Interstellar 

I found a really good video on YouTube which breaks down how Hans Zimmer creates the sound of space in Interstellar
- Wind, Air, High C, Major+Minor modes, melody, spaced chords. 
- Unnerving silence- then into the melodic part which will start with the one single high pitched penetrating sound. 
- Ends on the same one note that doesn't necessarily fade but just keeps going
- Through lines can be a broken melody which is realised later on. 

## Week 4 Diary and Reflections 

Start of the week : Dark Winds sound - I will first focus on this. I want it to be between 1 to 2 minutes long, and it should sound like the winds of space, it's the sort of sound one should hear upon first opening the spaceship door and staring out into space and these winds with the hum and bubble of the spaceship/space station machinery droning on in the background. 

End of the week : I don't think I have yet captured the right kind of wind, and something about it feels incomplete but I am unsure how to tie it all together yet. One idea I have is to include a low perceivable tone, a drone, maybe a low C or a low Bb. This could help bring out the sound of the background machinery amidst the sounds of the wind.
