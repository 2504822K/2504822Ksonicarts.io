# WEEK 1
# General Idea Generation

In the first week and also prior to the first week of this project, I had been thinking of what kind of projects I would like to make. I made multiple lists of prject ideas. 
Below is a list of some of the ideas I came up with: 

[Initial ideas](https://github.com/2504822K/mysonicartsdocumentation.io/assets/145678268/00b836b9-4028-4f0d-a589-0b5658ba0bc0)

The ideas I came up with were often inspired by various pieces of music or audiovisual pieces I had watched or listened to. Some ideas were based on sounds that I like and wanted to emulate. 
Sometimes my ideas were too ambitious when I compared them to factors such as the timeline, the workload of a fourth year student, as well as my own skills in whichever techonlogy or genre of music I was envisioning. !
