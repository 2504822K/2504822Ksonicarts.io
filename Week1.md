# WEEK 1
## IDEA GENERATION 
 
In the first week and also prior to the first week of this project, I had been thinking of what kind of projects I would like to make. I made multiple lists of project ideas. 
Below is a list of some of the ideas I came up with: 

## Possible Project Ideas

### Text to speech Audiovisual track (Ableton or Reaper) 
- Create track in Ableton or Reaper
- Track must be bass heavy
- Have a drum machine
- Create Visuals in MAX 4 Live or MAX MSP
- Can first try using MAX4LIVE devices for visualisation. 
- To include speech, maybe in the form of text to speech or computerised speech

### Granualar Synthesiser 
- Develop a granular synthesiser that manipulates sound samples in subtle ways, creating new textures and timbres.
- Allow dynamic control over parameters like grain size, density, pitch, and envelope.

### Ambient Sound Generator (MAX MSP)
- Create a MAX MSP patch that generates ambient sounds based on sample input. 
- Develop different parameters that can change the sound slightly 
- Create visual imagery, kind of like the meditation videos on YouTube. It could be a 24/7 stream on YouTube.

### Space Inspired piece of music 
- Can it be audiovisual ?
- Use NASA's free sound folder.

### Algorithmic Composition Tool 
- Build a system for generating music algorithmically. 
- Provide user interfaces to influence and interact with the generative process of the music. 

### Reflection 

The ideas I have come up with are inspired by various pieces of music or audiovisual pieces I have watched or listened to. Some ideas are based on sounds that I like and want to emulate. 
Some of my ideas seem too ambitious when I compare them to factors such as the timeline, the workload of a fourth year student, as well as my own skills in whichever techonlogy or genre of music I envision.  

### For example, of the ideas above: 
- The text to speech idea was inspired by an album by Lucy Liyou called [Welfare/Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moMSYxjvRZg&list=OLAK5uy_nA1YFV0j9MI7FPBmBpOS99jDdznl29Nuo&index=2&ab_channel=LucyLiyou-Topic)   
- The Granular synthesiser and the Algorithmic composition tool ideas were too amibtious for my current skill level. Infact I was not even sure how to start building an algorithmic composition tool.
