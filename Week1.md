# WEEK 1
# General Idea Generation

In the first week and also prior to the first week of this project, I had been thinking of what kind of projects I would like to make. I made multiple lists of prject ideas. 
Below is a list of some of the ideas I came up with: 

![Initial ideas](https://github.com/2504822K/mysonicartsdocumentation.io/assets/145678268/e38e4f79-7490-48b5-bd05-560e656d6254)

The ideas I came up with were often inspired by various pieces of music or audiovisual pieces I had watched or listened to. Some ideas were based on sounds that I liked and wanted to emulate. 
Sometimes my ideas were too ambitious when I compared them to factors such as the timeline, the workload of a fourth year student, as well as my own skills in whichever techonlogy or genre of music I was envisioning. 

### For example, of the ideas in the picture above: 
- The text to speech idea was inspired by an album by Lucy Liyou.
- The Granular synthesiser and the Algorithmic composition tool ideas were too amibtious for my current skill level. Infact I was not even sure how to start building an algorithmic composition tool.
