# WEEK 1
## IDEA GENERATION 
 
In the first week and also prior to the first week of this project, I had been thinking of what kind of projects I would like to make. I made multiple lists of prject ideas. 
Below is a list of some of the ideas I came up with: 

## Possible Project Ideas

### Text to speech Audiovisual track (Ableton or Reaper) 
- Create track in Ableton
- Track must be bass heavy
- Have a drum machine
- Create Visuals in MAX 4 Live or MAX MSP
- Can first try using MAX4LIVE device called Visualiser
- To include speech, maybe in the form of text to speech or computerised speech

Example Videos for Inspiration : Sinus Brute: Episode 3 - Great Video for compartmentalisation of ideas.

### Granualar Synthesiser 
- Develop a granular synthesiser that manipulates sound samples in subtle ways, creating new textures and timbres.
- Allow dynamic control over parameters like grain size, density, pitch, and envelope.

### Ambient Sound Generator (MAX MSP)
- Create a MAX MSP patch that generates ambient sounds based on sample input. 
- Develop different parameters that can change the sound slightly 
- Create visual imagery, kind of like the meditation videos on YouTube. It could be a 24/7 stream on YouTube.

### Space Inspired piece of music 
- Can it be audiovisual ?
- Use NASA's free sound folder.

### Algorithmic Composition Tool 
- Build a system for generating music algorithmically. 
- Provide user interfaces to influence and interact with the generative process of the music. 


The ideas I came up with were often inspired by various pieces of music or audiovisual pieces I had watched or listened to. Some ideas were based on sounds that I liked and wanted to emulate. 
Sometimes my ideas were too ambitious when I compared them to factors such as the timeline, the workload of a fourth year student, as well as my own skills in whichever techonlogy or genre of music I was envisioning. 

### For example, of the ideas in the picture above: 
- The text to speech idea was inspired by an album by Lucy Liyou.
- The Granular synthesiser and the Algorithmic composition tool ideas were too amibtious for my current skill level. Infact I was not even sure how to start building an algorithmic composition tool.
