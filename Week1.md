# WEEK 1
# General Idea Generation

In the first week and also prior to the first week of this project, I had been thinking of what kind of projects I would like to make. I made multiple lists of prject ideas. 
Below is a list of some of the ideas I came up with: 

## Possible Project Ideas

### Text to speech Audiovisual track (Ableton or Reaper) 
-- Create track in Ableton
-- Track must be bass heavy
-- Have a drum machine
-- Create Visuals in MAX 4 Live or MAX MSP
-- Can first try using MAX4LIVE device called Visualiser
-- To include speech, maybe in the form of text to speech or computerised speech


The ideas I came up with were often inspired by various pieces of music or audiovisual pieces I had watched or listened to. Some ideas were based on sounds that I liked and wanted to emulate. 
Sometimes my ideas were too ambitious when I compared them to factors such as the timeline, the workload of a fourth year student, as well as my own skills in whichever techonlogy or genre of music I was envisioning. 

### For example, of the ideas in the picture above: 
- The text to speech idea was inspired by an album by Lucy Liyou.
- The Granular synthesiser and the Algorithmic composition tool ideas were too amibtious for my current skill level. Infact I was not even sure how to start building an algorithmic composition tool.
