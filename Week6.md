# WEEK 6

## MAIN COMPOSITION WEEK 

### AIM

The main aim of week 6 was to create the main elements of the piece. I luckily had already created a melody the previous week which has helped me situate other parts of the composition. 

### What I need to work on

- Shape of the wind sounds, in particular how to fade in and out the various winds sounds. 
- The middle section should have some sort of melody or chords
- Add movement to the piece so that it doesnt sound so static

### Reflections 

At the beginninhg of the week: I am having trouble with volumes. I recorded my sampled sounds and melody too low because I initially envisioned them as background sounds. I have increased each track volume but it is still very low. I canâ€™t hear it without my headphones.

Middle of the week: I have discovered that the problem is not entirely because my track volumes are too low, the problem is that my computer speakers are not good enough to pick up the bass sounds that most of the track is composed of.

End of the week: I composed the crescendo and the final parts of the piece. The crescendo was very difficult to compose because I couldnt figure out the perfect crescendo points. It still feels a little weak. I have so far only used the static sound to build it, but I think adding a few textured sounds could really make it shine. I especially like the build up to it. It's very satisfying. I also found the perfect place to fade the melody towards the start of the piece. It flows nicely. However, I am still in two minds about including the melody at the very end of the piece. I am worried it will sound too disjointed.The aim for next week is to finish a first draft of the piece and send it for feedback to my lecturer. I also need to figure out if I am working on either visuals or another piece.
