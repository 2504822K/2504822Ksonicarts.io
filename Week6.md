# WEEK 6

## MAIN COMPOSITION WEEK 

### AIM

The main aim of this week is to create the main elements of the piece. I luckily managed to create a melodic idea over the weekend. This idea has helped me situate where other componets of the composition could go.

I created a sample using Reaper's Reasynth and my midi keyboard, I then used Reaper's time stretch algorithm to stetch and affcet the sample sound. This gave the sound a slight echo and prolonged the notes. I then used Reaper's sampler to compose a melody on my keyboard. I  also added other effects to smooth out the sound. Later on I also used the inbuild piano in reaper when creating simple ideas such as the oscillating notes in the B section of the piece. 

Below is a picture of the effects I added to shape the melodic idea.

### What I need to work on

- Shape of the wind sounds, in particular how to fade in and out the various winds sounds.
- I think sometimes the melody is peaking or too sharp in places, but I am unsure
- The middle section should have some sort of melody or chords. 
- Add movement/ motion or contrast to the piece so that it doesnt sound so static. 

### Reflections 

#### At the beginninhg of the week

I am having trouble with volumes. I recorded my sampled sounds and melody too low because I initially envisioned them as background sounds. I have increased each track volume but it is still very low. I canâ€™t hear it without my headphones.

#### Middle of the week

I have discovered that the problem is not entirely because my track volumes are too low, the problem is that my computer speakers are not good enough to pick up the bass sounds that most of the track is composed of. I think I need to get better headphones to improve this aspect of the composition. 

#### End of the week

I composed the crescendo and the final parts of the piece. The crescendo was very difficult to compose because I couldnt figure out the perfect crescendo points. It still feels a little weak. I have so far only used the static sound to build it, but I think adding a few textured sounds could really make it shine. I especially like the build up to it. It's very satisfying. I also found the perfect place to fade the melody towards the start of the piece. It flows nicely. However, I am still in two minds about including the melody at the very end of the piece. I am worried it will sound too disjointed.The aim for next week is to finish a first draft of the piece and send it for feedback to my lecturer. I also need to figure out if I am working on either visuals or another piece.
