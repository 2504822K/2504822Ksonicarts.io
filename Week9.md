# WEEK 9

## FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to correct all the mistakes and improvements that my lecturer pointed out/suggested in the first track. Secondly, to make a start enriching this first track using the glitchy sounds I have created. 
 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I received some really helpful feedback from my lecturer. He confirmed my fears that the middle section could do with further development, so I have used some of these glitchy sounds to develop this section. I have sound designed three more sounds which have really brought out the middle section. To add to this, the new added sounds are subtle enough to not overshadow the crescendo which is something I was worried about previously.  He also unfortuanely pointed out the fact that my track is too quiet and could use some more mixing... working on this too. It is not my strong suite.
  
- I spent some time today watching videos on YouTube about mixing, I have a better idea of some techniques such as EQing to remove unwanted frequencies, using compression to control dynamics, and adding reverb for spatial depth and I have used some of these ideas throughout the track. I have also ordered a better pair of headphones to contiunue working on this issue. 

#### End of the week 

- I think my mix is sounding better overall, but I will not be sure until I use the better headphones. I have also realised that I do not like how the melody just abruptly returns at the end of the piece so I have created some additional sounds which I think work well to introduce the melody again. 

 

- This has defintely been the least productive week so far!
