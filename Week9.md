# WEEK 9

## STARTING TRACK TWO

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to correct all the mistakes and improvements that my lecturer pointed out/suggested in the first track. Secondly, to make a start on the second piece using the materials I have collected. I should at least have the start of the second piece done or have created some undercurrents/background ambience for it. 
 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I am really struggling coming up with fresh ideas for this new piece. I want it to be connected in theme to the other piece, however I would like use less NASA sounds, instead I would like to design my own sounds to make most of the piece out of them. I learnt some sound design methods in the previous piece so I am keen to build on those skills to design sounds that emulate space or anything space related in this new piece.

- I received some really helpful feedback from my lecturer. He confirmed my fears that the middle section could do with further development, so I have spent some time working on that too. I have sound designed three more sounds which have really brought out the middle section. To add to this, the new added sounds are subtle enough to not overshadow the crescendo which is something I was worried about previously.  He also unfortuanely pointed out the fact that my track is too quiet and could use some more mixing... working on this too. It is not my strong suite. 


#### Middle of the week 

- I have tried to use MAX MSP to compose and arrange track 2 since most of the sounds I made for it last week were created using MAX MSP. However I am struggling a lot with this and I not have as much time to contnue experiementing. I think I need to use Reaper instead. 


#### End of the week 

- I have still not managed to create anything out of both the sounds I created last week and some news I created this week. The main issue is that I can't quite figure out how many sounds I need or how they might fit together. I am stuck designing more and more sounds.

- I have also finalised the first piece, now all my attension will be on the second track only. I might send the first track to my lecturer again especially since I have had so much difficulty with the sound levels. 

- This has defintely been the least productive week so far!
