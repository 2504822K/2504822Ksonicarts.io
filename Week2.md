# WEEK 2
## Narrowing down Ideas

After the first week, I was inspired by both my previous initial ideas from week 1, and what we had discussed in class that week. I also used the template given to us to think through my ideas and structure my thoughts. This template helped me narrow down my ideas, by thinking through aspects such as what outcomes did I want out of the project, what examples did I have for what the outcome could look like. And in what form would the final project take. For example, would it be a MAX Patch, an audio file, a video file, a website etc 

Please see below a copy of my template:

As you can see in the template, I had amalgamated different ideas from some of my week 1 ideas to form one idea. My chosen idea at this point was to either produce a one long piece or 4 short pieces to form an EP. This EP idea was to use space sounds from NASA. I however still had no deciced on what format the piece would take: audiovisual or just audio.
