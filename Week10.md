# WEEK 10

## FINISHING TRACK TWO

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to complete track 2 and send it to my lecturer for feedback if possible. 

This week I created the entirety of track 2. I used the same sound design I had used for the melodic idea in track 1 to creating the openning of track 2, I think this will help the piece appear to be from the same sound world which was my aim for track 2.  In addition to other background sounds, I have also added some of the wind sounds from track 1 so that the environment both tracks are set in is similar. 

I created track 2 using similar sound design and composition ideas as in track 1, however I did not create a concrete narrative to aid my composition process as I did for track 1. I used 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I am worried I am running out of time, although I have all the sounds I need. I am struggling putting them together into a comprehensible piece or a piece of music which I like. I think I need to listen to loads of music for inspiration. 

#### Middle of the week 

- I have spent a lot of time on YouTube listening to music. And I have came up with a couple of ideas for the composition. I created [a really interesting sound out of the mellow1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mHxW46Hgr4&list=OLAK5uy_k4LFDBnV6X9Oj0nJfjOaVtkjvVbRbzS78&ab_channel=LucyLiyou-Topic) I created in week 8, I am not sure how I will use it, but I would really like to add it to track 2. 
 
#### End of the week 

- The piece is completed. I struggled with it much more than I did with the first one. I think maybe because I went for a less melody based idea with this one...I am not sure. I will see if I have time the following week to work on it some more so that I can continue to refine some of the ideas.
