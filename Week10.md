# WEEK 10

## FINISHING The COMPOSITION

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to complete the track and send it to my lecturer if possible for further feedback.  

I used similar sounds that I had used for the melodic ideas at the beginning of the piece to creating the [groaning sounds](https://soundcloud.com/2504822k/track2opening?si=6ab6547d5d2d4cd8ab70cd509b8cd743&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing), which are heard before the melody is reintroduced at the end of the piece. I think this helps ease in the entry of the melody so that it is smoother and less abrupt. 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I am worried I am running out of time, although I have all the sounds I need. I am struggling putting them together into a comprehensible section of music at the end. I think I need to listen to a lot of music for inspiration. 

#### Middle of the week 

- I have spent a lot of time on YouTube listening to music. And I have came up with a couple of ideas for how to edit the rest of the composition. I created [a really interesting sound out of the mellow1](https://soundcloud.com/2504822k/woowootrackfuzz1?si=6ab6547d5d2d4cd8ab70cd509b8cd743&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) I created in week 8, I am not sure how I will use it, but I would really like to add it to the track

- Below is a picture of the effects I  have added to the mellow1 track to change how it sounds as desribed above.

#### End of the week 

- The piece is completed. I did not end up finding an appropriate use for the sound above, as it did not fit into the sound world and the overall mood of the piece.
