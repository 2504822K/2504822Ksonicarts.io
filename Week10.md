# WEEK 10

## FINISHING TRACK TWO

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to complete track 2 and send it to my lecturer for feedback if possible. 

This week I created the entirety of track 2. I used I had used for the melodic idea in track 1 to creating the [opening of track 2](https://soundcloud.com/2504822k/track2opening?si=6ab6547d5d2d4cd8ab70cd509b8cd743&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing), I think this will help the piece appear to be from the same sound world which was my aim for track 2.  In addition to other background sounds, I have also added some of the wind sounds from track 1 so that the environment both tracks are set in is similar. 

I created track 2 using similar sound design and composition techniques as in track 1, however I did not create a concrete narrative to aid my composition process as I did for track 1. I took inspiration from track 1's narrative and sound world. 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I am worried I am running out of time, although I have all the sounds I need. I am struggling putting them together into a comprehensible piece or a piece of music which I like. I think I need to listen to a lot of music for inspiration. 

#### Middle of the week 

- I have spent a lot of time on YouTube listening to music. And I have came up with a couple of ideas for the composition. I created [a really interesting sound out of the mellow1](https://soundcloud.com/2504822k/woowootrackfuzz1?si=6ab6547d5d2d4cd8ab70cd509b8cd743&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) I created in week 8, I am not sure how I will use it, but I would really like to add it to track 2.

- Below is a picture of the effects I  have added to the mellow1 track to change how it sounds sounds desribed above.

#### End of the week 

- The piece is completed. I struggled with it much more than I did with the first one. I think maybe because I went for a less melody based idea with this one...I am not sure. I will see if I have time the following week to work on it some more so that I can continue to refine some of the ideas. 

#### End of the project

- The Waveshaper and waveshapping distortion effects were instrumental to the composition of track 2 and I ended up using them a couple of times such as in [this sound](https://soundcloud.com/2504822k/paramdistorted?si=29480f3de1e04a92ada51a24196cb3c9&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) which is found towards the end of track 2.
