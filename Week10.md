# WEEK 10

## FINISHING TRACK TWO

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to complete track 2 and send it to my lecturer for feedback if possible. 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I am worried I am running out of time, although I have all the sounds I need. I am struggling putting them together into a comprehensible piece or a piece of music which I like. I think I need to listen to loads of music for inspiration. 

#### Middle of the week 

- I have spent a lot of time on YouTube listening to music and I am still lost. However the piece is coming along nicely. I think I will need to stay up late tonight to make some serious progress on it. 
 
#### End of the week 

- The piece is completed. I struggled with it much more than I did with the first one. I think maybe because I went for a less melody based idea with this one...I am not sure. I have sent it to my lecturer, but I don't really know if he will get back to me in time. I have very little time between now and the deadline.
