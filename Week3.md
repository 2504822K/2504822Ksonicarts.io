# WEEK 3
## GETTING DOWN TO THE SPECIFICS

At the end of week 2, I had a tutorial with my lecteurer who advised me to be as specific as possible in my idea formation phase. So for week 3, I comprehensively examined my idea, and got down to the specifs. I also prepared a project presentation which showcased my ideas. 

### Project Presentation
The project presentation I made can be downloaded using the link below. It is divided into the following sections: 
- General Idea: An indepth explanation of my Idea
- Inspirations: Which music and artists have inspired my idea or which artists will I try to emulate as well what aspects of their work am I looking at for inspiration.
- Methods: What are my methods of composition ?
- Summary:A summary of my thoughts, expectations for the project as well as my biggest concerns in embarking on this project.
