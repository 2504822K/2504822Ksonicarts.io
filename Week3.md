#GETTING DOWN TO THE SPECIFICS

At the end of week 2, I had a tutorial with my lecteurer who advised me to be as specific as possible in my idea formation phase. So for week 3, I comprehensively examined my idea, and got down to the specifs. I also prepared a project presentation which showcased my ideas.
