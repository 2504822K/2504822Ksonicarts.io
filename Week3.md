# WEEK 3
## GETTING DOWN TO THE SPECIFICS

At the end of week 2, I had a tutorial with my lecteurer who advised me to be as specific as possible in my idea formation phase. So for week 3, I comprehensively examined my idea, and got down to the specifs. I also prepared a project presentation which showcased my ideas. 

### More Ideas for Sonic Arts Project
I brainstormed some moreideas for the project taking into account my lecterer's advice

#### Resources
- NASA free space sounds, Need to figure out which ones as the folder is very large.
- Max4live Sonic Geometry, I could create geometric based sounds on MAX MSP
  
 #### Visual Ideas
- Rainbow effect- Louise Harris' Alocas is 
- Using Points eg Noise
- Very Gradual (Both the audio and the visuals)
- Circular or Geometric shapes (If not points the maybe this)
  
#### Sound Ideas
- Melodic
- Heavy Bass
- Sound bed or undercurrent (I could start with this undercurrent, the idea in mind is the undercurrent sound used in alot of RAP music. I reference [this tutorial]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00Vz7ybWp_c)) by The Daydream Sound on YouTube for instructions on how to compose an undercurrent, and then translate the ideas to experiental electronic music I am aiming to make.
