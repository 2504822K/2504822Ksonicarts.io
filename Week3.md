# WEEK 3
## GETTING DOWN TO THE SPECIFICS

At the end of week 2, I had a tutorial with my lecturer who advised me to be as specific as possible in my idea formation phase. So for week 3, I comprehensively examined my idea, and got down to the specifs. I also prepared a project presentation which showcased my ideas. 

### More Ideas for Sonic Arts Project
I brainstormed some more ideas for the project taking into account my lecturer's advice.

#### Resources
- NASA free space sounds, need to figure out which ones as the folder is very large.
- Max4live Sonic Geometry, I could create geometric based sounds on MAX MSP

#### Visual Ideas
- Rainbow effect- like Louise Harris' Alocas. 
- Using Points eg Noise
- Very Gradual (both the audio and the visuals)
- Circular or Geometric shapes (If not points then maybe this)
  
#### Sound Ideas
- Melodic
- Heavy Bass
- Sound bed or undercurrent (I could start with this undercurrent, the idea in mind is the undercurrent sound used in alot of RAP music. [This tutorial]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?]) by The Daydream Sound on YouTube could be helpful for learning how to compose an undercurrent, and then translating the ideas to the experiental electronic music I am aiming to make. 

### Project Presentation
The project presentation I made can be downloaded using the link below. It is divided into the following sections: 
- General Idea: An indepth explanation of my Idea
- Inspirations: Which music and artists have inspired my idea or which artists will I try to emulate as well what aspects of their work am I looking at for inspiration.
- Methods: What are my methods of composition ?
- Summary: A summary of my thoughts, expectations for the project as well as my biggest concerns in embarking on this project.
