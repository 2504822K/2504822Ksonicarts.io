# WEEK 11

## Aim 
The aim of this week is to make final edits on the piece based on my lecturerâ€™s feedback, complete writing and editing my reflection and documentation and then submit the entire project.  I also need to brainstorm a track name as I do not like the current track titled. I will then be in a position to submit the project before the deadline. 


### Reflections 

#### End of the Project
- This is my final update, I will shortly be submitting the project. I really enjoyed working on this project although I found it very challenging coming up with ideas. I think this was especially stressful because I had a deadline looming, I felt like I couldn't sit back and let ideas come to me, I had to go out looking for them and I did this mostly by listening to a lot of music from all kinds of genres, not just experimental music.

- I learnt many new skills especially in sound design which I have discovered I enjoy doing. I think going forwards, I want to do a short course on sound design so that I have a better understanding of what the different effects I am using will have on the sounds I am making. I feel like this is the aspect which held me back the most. Often whilst I had the sound I wanted to create in mind, I couldn't quite make it because I didn't know which effects did what. I spent a lot of time doing research which not only slowed down my progress but also stifle my creativity, because by the time I researched the right technique or effect to use, the idea will have faded in my brain and I could not recreate it the exact way I originally envisioned it.
  
-  I also struggled a lot with mixing my sounds so I would like to learn more about this aspect as it was my weakest area. However overall, this was a fun and positive experience.
