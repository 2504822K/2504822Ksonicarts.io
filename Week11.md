# WEEEK 11

## Aim 
The aim of this week is to making corrections on the second piece based on my lecturer’s feedback, complete writing and editing my reflection and documentation and then submit the entire project. 

### Reflections 

#### Beginning of the Week
-  I am just reviewing my lecturers’ feedback on track two. I also need to brainstorm project names and track names. After this, I will be in a position to submit the project before the deadline. My lecturer pointed out the following issues and ways I could improve track two

#### End of the Week 
- This is my final update, I will shortly be submitting the project. I really enjoyed working on this project although I found it very challenging coming up with ideas. I think this was especially stressful because I had a deadline looming, I felt like I couldnt sit back and let ideas come to me, I had to go out looking for them and I did this mostly by listening to a lot of music from all kinds of genres, not just experimental music.

- I learnt many new skills especially in sound design which I have discovered I enjoy doing. I think going forwards, I want to do a short course on sound design so that I have a better understanding of what the different effects I am using will have on the sounds I am making. I feel like this is the aspect which held me back the most. Often whilst I had the sound I wanted to create in mind, I couldnt quite make it because I didnt know which effects did what. I spent a lot of time doing research which not only slowed down my progress but also stifled my creativity, because by the time I researched the right technique or effect to use, the idea will have faded in my brain and I could not recreate it the exact way I originally envisioned it.
  
-  I also struggled alot with mixing my sounds so I would like to learn more about this aspect as it was my weakest area. However overall, this was a fun and positive experience.
