# WEEK 8 

## THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PROJECT 

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to either create the visual side of the piece or get started on the next audio only piece or to add to the current piece to make it slightly longer to the required eight minutes. I am unsure which direction I want to take the project. Whilst it would be great to create two pieces and also visuals for both pieces. I think at my current skill level, I will not be able to work fast enough to achieve this within the remaining time. 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I have started with creating some visuals which is coming along okay... I am not sure if I should continue to create visuals for the project or just create a whole other track. To avoid wasting time, I think I should just jump in and create visuals whilst also generating ideas for a second track.  (just in case) 

#### Middle of the week 

- I created a number of MAX visual patches and also a bunch of MAX patches to generate glitchy sounds. I think I want to go for a glitchy abstract piece if I do another track instead. I am still undecided and I am feelinmg a little bit stressed because time is running out.

#### End of the week 

- With all the audio glitches I have created for the second track, I have realised that It wil be better if I used this audio to further enrich the fast track and also to compose it so that it is a little longer. This is because I think this idea will work best for my overall project rather than creating a quick second piece which will most likely lack the depth and character the first one has. Also I am conscious of time and I have not gotten any inspiration from the visual ideas I have come up with, however the glitchy sounds I have created this week have given me some possible avenues to delve into and develop into full ideas.
