# WEEK 8 

## THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PROJECT 

### Aim

The main aim of this week is to either create the visual side of the piece or get started on the next audio only piece. I am unsure which direction I want to take the project. Whilst it would be great to create two pieces and also visuals for both pieces. I think at my current skill level, I will not be able to work fast enough to achieve this within the remaining time. I have to choose one, either creating visual ideas for track one or creating a second audio only track. 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the week 

- I have started with creating some visuals which is coming along okay... I am not sure if I should continue to create visuals for the project or just create a whole other track. To avoid wasting time, I think I should just jump in and create visuals whilst also generating ideas for a second track.  (just in case) 

#### Middle of the week 

- I created a bunch of MAX visual patches and also a bunch of MAX patches to generate glitchy sounds. I think I want to go for a glitchy abstract piece if I do another track instead. I am still undecided and I am feelinmg a little bit stressed because time is running out.

#### End of the week 

- I have decided to just create a second audio only piece instead of visualising the first one. This is because I think this idea will work best for my overall project simply visualising the first one. Also I am conscious of time and I have not gotten any inspiration from the visual ideas I have come up with, however the glitchy sounds I have created this week have given me some possible avenues to delve into and develop into full ideas.
