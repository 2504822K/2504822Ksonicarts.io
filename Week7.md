# WEEK 7

## FINALISING TRACK ONE

### Aim

The main aim of week 7 is to complete track one and also make sure the volumes are sounding better. Afterwards, send the piece for feedback to my lecturer. 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the Week
- I sound designed some textures using a few NASA sounds and a bunch of effects. They have really improved the crescendo point. However something is still missing. The main goal of this crescendo is to show panic and distress in the character I am envisioning. Right now it sounds  good, but the distress is not coming through enough. 

#### Middle of the week
- I have figured out what to add to make the distress come through. I need a high pitched sound, sort of like a ringing in the ear. I added this sound and it is working out nicely. I also added another sound from NASA to the crescendo and I now think it's complete. The textures I created in this section create the exact effect I had in mind, which is that of fear and utter panic. 

#### End of the week 
- I sent the entire project to my lecturer for feedback. However, I am not sure if the piece is fully done. I was in two minds about adding more sound to the middle section because I feel this section is too sparse and maybe boring. But the again I am worried if I add more to this section, it will feel crowded and will not have the desired effect for when the crescendo does come along which is really the most impactful moment of the entire piece.
