# WEEK 7

## FINALISING TRACK ONE

### Aim

The main aim of week 7 is to complete track one and also make sure the volumes are sounding better. Afterwards, I want to send the piece for feedback to my lecturer. 


I have spent the majority of this week working on the middle (B) section of the piece. I added various sound effects to the build up to make it more intense. Some of them I sound designed myself such as the [C-tone](https://soundcloud.com/2504822k/c-tone?si=29480f3de1e04a92ada51a24196cb3c9&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) , which I added for the purpose of creating a tinnutus sound like the sound used in movies in moments of distress or panic. I also added [NASA's DelatIV audio](https://soundcloud.com/2504822k/deltaivaudio?si=29480f3de1e04a92ada51a24196cb3c9&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) 
 These sounds have added much needed contrast to the piece. I also ensure to add the wind sound which serve as an undercurrent or background ambience as previously discussed. 

### Reflections

#### Beginning of the Week
- I sound designed some textures using a NASA sounds and also sound designed my own sounds. They have really improved the lead up to the B section. The main goal of this B section is to show panic and distress, however, right now it sounds good, but the distress is not coming through enough. 

#### Middle of the week
- I have figured out what to add to make the distress come through. I need a high pitched sound, sort of like a ringing in the ear. I added this sound and it is working out nicely. I also added another sound from NASA to the crescendo and I now think it's complete. The textures I created in this section create the exact effect I had in mind, which is that of fear and utter panic.
  
- Intially I did some research and thought a shephard tone would really work well to achieve the above purpose so I tried to learn how to compose one. The picture below shows my notes when I was researching shephard tones.

#### End of the week 
- I sent the entire project to my lecturer for feedback. However, I am not sure if the piece is fully done. I was in two minds about adding more sound to the middle section because I feel this section is too sparse and maybe boring. But then again I am worried if I add more to this section, it will feel crowded and will not have the desired effect for when the crescendo does come along which is really the most impactful moment of the entire piece.
